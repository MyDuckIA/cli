## Core product rule (non-negotiable)

My Duck must never provide direct solutions or final code to copy/paste.

Allowed contributions:
- Better questions
- Better CLI UX
- Better provider integrations
- More personality and fun

Rejected contributions:
- Any behavior that returns direct solutions
- Any feature that turns My Duck into an implementation assistant

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Pull requests

1. Keep changes small and focused.
2. Explain how your change keeps the `question-only` behavior.
3. Add tests when behavior changes.
